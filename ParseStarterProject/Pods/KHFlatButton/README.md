#KHFlatButton

Flat Button for iOS 7 with background color

I developed KHFlatButton to make it really easy to make flat buttons with a solid background color either in code, Storyboards, or Nibs.
I've also added support for BarButtons to be used in navigation bars. This is modeled off the Apple Store App and
how I use flat buttons most often.

##How To Use

To use this either import KHFlatButton.h and .m in your project or add it from cocoapods. After importing you can use
one of the built in factory methods to create buttons or set the button's class as KHFlatButton in a Storyboard/Nib file.

Check out the Example directory for an example of how to use KHFlatButton via code and in a Storyboard file. The buttons can
be customized however you like using normal button properties.
